# Semantic differences from native Exasol

A few pushed-down functions return a different result than the same query on a native Exasol
table. Each difference on this page is a current compatibility gap. The
[Capabilities](capabilities.md) page lists which functions are pushed down.

## Case conversion of non-ASCII text

`UPPER`, `LOWER`, and `INITCAP` can return different text for non-ASCII characters. ASCII text
is not affected.

The difference comes from two case-mapping rules:

- Native Exasol maps each character to exactly one character. A character without a single-character mapping stays unchanged.
- The scan runs these functions in DataFusion, which applies Unicode full case mapping.

| Expression | Virtual schema | Native Exasol |
|---|---|---|
| `UPPER('straße')` | `STRASSE` | `STRAßE` |
| `LOWER('İ')` (Turkish dotted I) | `i̇` (two characters) | `i` |
| `INITCAP('ßa')` | `SSa` | `ßa` |

The difference also reaches results built on the converted text:

- `LENGTH(UPPER('ß'))` returns 2 instead of 1.
- A filter such as `WHERE UPPER(name) = 'STRAßE'` can return different rows.
