# Feature: End-to-End Harness

End-to-end test suite that exercises the full lakehouse VS query path — from Exasol SQL
through the adapter and scan UDF to Iceberg Parquet files in MinIO — verifying
correctness of projection, filter, and Iceberg file-pruning pushdown against a local
Exasol Docker container. The harness installs `LAKEHOUSE_SCAN` as a SCALAR EMIT script
and `LAKEHOUSE_DISTRIBUTE_FILES` as a LUA SET distributor script. See
`packaging/e2e-harness-grouped-agg` for grouped-aggregate and nested-aggregate E2E
scenarios.

## Background

* Every E2E scenario runs against a local Exasol Docker container over MinIO and MUST fail (never skip) when the stack is unavailable.
* All E2E tests run against a local Exasol Docker container with MinIO and the Iceberg REST catalog.
* All DSN/connection strings MUST include `validateservercertificate=0`.
* The file-pruning E2E seeds a partitioned Iceberg table whose data files are distributed
  across partition values, so a partition-column predicate can prune whole files.
* See `packaging/e2e-harness-grouped-order` for grouped-aggregate cases that deliberately
  place an aggregate before, between, or after the group keys in the `selectList` — the
  arrangement every case in this spec avoids.
* The provisioning helpers (SLC install, `.so` upload, script and Virtual Schema creation)
  are defined once in a shared `common/e2e_harness` module and reused by every E2E binary;
  per-binary variation is passed as explicit parameters.

## Scenarios

<!-- DELTA:NEW -->
### Scenario: Every E2E binary provisions the scan path from one shared harness definition

* *GIVEN* the `exasol-e2e` test binaries under `crates/lakehouse-engine/tests`, each with its own `OnceLock`-guarded setup
* *AND* a single shared `common/e2e_harness` module defining the SLC install, the `.so` upload, the script creation, and the Virtual Schema creation
* *WHEN* any binary's setup provisions the lakehouse VS scan path
* *THEN* the binary SHALL install `LAKEHOUSE_SCAN`, `LAKEHOUSE_DISTRIBUTE_FILES`, and the adapter script from that shared definition, so the script DDL is byte-identical across every binary
* *AND* the per-binary Virtual Schema properties that vary (VS name, Iceberg namespace, catalog CONNECTION name, `PARALLELISM_FACTOR`, `JOIN_BROADCAST_MAX_BYTES`) SHALL be supplied as explicit parameters rather than by re-declaring the provisioning logic
* *AND* an end-to-end query through any binary's Virtual Schema SHALL return results identical to the single-node DataFusion equivalent, and the affected tests MUST fail (not skip) when the Exasol Docker container or MinIO is unavailable
