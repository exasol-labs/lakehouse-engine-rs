# Feature: DataFusion Scan Execution — Memory Budgeting and Credential Passthrough

Extends the scan UDF to read the real per-instance memory limit from
`ctx.memory_limit()` and size the DataFusion memory pool from a *net* budget — the
per-instance limit minus a configurable container/binary overhead — scaled by a
configurable fraction, and to consume storage credentials carried in the scan spec
(including vended STS tokens) without re-authenticating to the catalog.

## Background

* The per-instance memory limit is read from `ctx.memory_limit()` (bytes; `0` =
  unknown sentinel). For a positive limit the pool is sized to
  `fraction × (limit − overhead_bytes)`, floored at a minimum non-zero budget,
  leaving headroom below the Exasol engine's 80% concurrency-stall threshold.
* The memory-pool fraction (default `0.6`) and the per-instance container-overhead
  megabytes (default `200`) are VS properties carried into the scan spec; a scan
  spec lacking them deserializes to those defaults.
* When the limit is the `0` sentinel, a conservative default budget is used and the
  fraction and overhead are ignored.
* Storage credentials (including vended S3 keys) reach the UDF only inside the
  ScanSpec; the UDF never contacts the catalog or re-requests credentials.
* Credentials MUST NOT appear in any error message.
* See `datafusion-scan/scan-execution` for the base scan execution scenarios.

## Scenarios

<!-- DELTA:CHANGED -->
### Scenario: Scan sizes its memory pool from the reported per-instance limit

* *GIVEN* a scan UDF invocation whose UDF context reports a positive per-instance memory limit via `ctx.memory_limit()`
* *AND* a scan spec carrying a memory-pool fraction and a per-instance container-overhead byte count
* *WHEN* the scan UDF builds its DataFusion session context
* *THEN* the UDF SHALL subtract the container-overhead bytes from the per-instance limit and size the DataFusion memory pool to the configured fraction of that net budget
* *AND* the resulting pool budget MUST stay below the Exasol engine's 80% concurrency-stall threshold for the reported limit
* *AND* the UDF MUST NOT hardcode the pool budget to the unknown-limit default when a positive limit is reported
<!-- /DELTA:CHANGED -->

<!-- DELTA:CHANGED -->
### Scenario: Scan falls back to the default budget when no memory limit is reported

* *GIVEN* a scan UDF invocation whose `ctx.memory_limit()` returns `0` (the unknown / unavailable sentinel)
* *WHEN* the scan UDF builds its DataFusion session context
* *THEN* the UDF SHALL size the DataFusion memory pool to the conservative default budget, ignoring the configured fraction and overhead
* *AND* the scan SHALL otherwise execute identically to the positive-limit path
<!-- /DELTA:CHANGED -->

<!-- DELTA:NEW -->
### Scenario: Scan clamps the memory pool to a minimum floor when overhead exceeds the limit

* *GIVEN* a scan UDF invocation whose `ctx.memory_limit()` reports a positive per-instance limit
* *AND* a scan spec whose container-overhead bytes are greater than or equal to that limit
* *WHEN* the scan UDF builds its DataFusion session context
* *THEN* the UDF SHALL clamp the DataFusion memory pool budget to a minimum non-zero floor rather than producing a zero or negative budget
* *AND* the scan SHALL still build a usable session context that can execute a scan
