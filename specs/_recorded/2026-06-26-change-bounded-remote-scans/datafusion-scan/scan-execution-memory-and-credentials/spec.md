# Feature: DataFusion Scan Execution — Memory Budgeting and Credential Passthrough

Extends the scan UDF to read the real per-instance memory limit from
`ctx.memory_limit()` and size the DataFusion memory pool from a *net* budget — the
per-instance limit minus a configurable container/binary overhead — scaled by a
configurable fraction, to bound the per-batch Parquet decode working set via a
configured `batch_size`, and to consume storage credentials carried in the scan spec
(including vended STS tokens) without re-authenticating to the catalog.

## Background

* The per-instance memory limit is read from `ctx.memory_limit()` (bytes; `0` =
  unknown sentinel). For a positive limit the pool is sized to
  `fraction × (limit − overhead_bytes)`, floored at a minimum non-zero budget.
* The DataFusion memory pool bounds aggregation, sort, and join — but NOT the
  Parquet→Arrow decode and scan buffers. The configured `batch_size` is the lever
  that bounds that out-of-pool working set.
* The `batch_size` is carried in the scan spec; a spec lacking it deserializes to a
  conservative built-in default, and a sub-1 value is clamped to 1.
* Storage credentials (including vended S3 keys) reach the UDF only inside the
  ScanSpec; the UDF never contacts the catalog or re-requests credentials.
* Credentials MUST NOT appear in any error message.
* See `datafusion-scan/scan-execution` for the base scan execution scenarios.

## Scenarios

<!-- DELTA:NEW -->
### Scenario: Scan bounds the Parquet decode working set via a configured batch size

* *GIVEN* a scan UDF building its DataFusion session configuration for a scan spec
* *WHEN* the UDF builds the `SessionConfig` (`session_config_for_spec`)
* *THEN* the UDF SHALL set the DataFusion `batch_size` so the per-batch Parquet decode and scan working set stays bounded, rather than leaving it at the DataFusion default
* *AND* the configured `batch_size` SHALL be sourced from the scan spec when present and otherwise from a conservative built-in default, clamped to at least 1
* *AND* the bound SHALL apply on both the raw-row scan path and the partial-aggregate path, since both decode source Parquet files
