# Feature: DataFusion Scan Execution — Spec Reconstitution

Extends `datafusion-scan/scan-execution` with the mechanics of the scan UDF's two-argument
input: a shard-invariant common-spec JSON blob (arg 0) and a per-shard file list (arg 1),
which the UDF deserializes and merges into one `ScanSpec` before running the shared scan path.

## Background

* The scan UDF's first argument is the shard-invariant common spec (projection, filter,
  limit, aggregates, group keys, logical schema, EMITS types, storage credentials, the
  Iceberg table root, and tuning knobs), serialized once per fan-out; the second argument is
  this shard's file list. See `datafusion-scan/scan-execution` for the scan behavior once the
  spec is merged.
* The per-shard file list is a JSON array of compact `[path, size]` 2-tuples, where `path` is
  either relative to the common spec's table root or an absolute URI, and `size` is the file's
  byte size resolved from the Iceberg manifest by the adapter.
* `ScanSpec` carries no catalog identifier block — the scan UDF never contacts the catalog.
* A parse failure on either argument MUST surface an error identifying scan-spec
  deserialization failure and MUST NOT contain any storage access key, secret key, or
  session token.

## Scenarios

### Scenario: Scan reconstitutes the ScanSpec from the common and per-shard arguments

* *GIVEN* a scan invocation whose first argument is a common-spec JSON blob carrying every shard-invariant field (including the Iceberg table root) and whose second argument is a JSON array of `[path, size]` 2-tuples
* *WHEN* the scan UDF parses its two input arguments
* *THEN* the UDF SHALL deserialize the common-spec JSON and the per-shard file-list JSON and MERGE them into one `ScanSpec` value whose `files` are the `(path, size)` entries from the second argument and whose every other field — including the table root — comes from the first argument, equivalent to the pre-split single-argument spec for the same shard
* *AND* the merge SHALL store each file entry's path verbatim (relative or absolute) without resolving it, so path reconstruction is deferred to file registration (see `datafusion-scan/scan-execution`)
* *AND* a parse failure on either argument SHALL surface an error that identifies scan-spec deserialization failure and MUST NOT contain any storage access key, secret key, or session token
* *AND* the reconstituted `ScanSpec` MUST NOT carry any catalog identifier field, because the scan UDF never contacts the catalog

### Scenario: A file-list argument that predates the size and relative-path encoding still reconstitutes

* *GIVEN* a scan invocation whose common-spec JSON carries no table root (an empty or absent root) and whose second argument holds file entries
* *WHEN* the scan UDF parses its two input arguments
* *THEN* the UDF SHALL deserialize the file list, treating a missing table root as "all paths are absolute" so no path is joined onto a root
* *AND* the resulting `ScanSpec` SHALL be usable by the shared scan path unchanged, because the same `.so` produces and consumes the spec within one deploy (there is no cross-version wire-compatibility requirement)
